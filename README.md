- 👋 Hi, I’m @vierija
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to be a better programmer, in simple one-man projects and Doom (1993) level design. Also creative writing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, and been thinking of picking up a little Python for work-related projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, I don't think I'd be currently an asset to any collaborative project :D
- 📫 How to reach me: 📧 janne dot vieri ät gmail dot com.
